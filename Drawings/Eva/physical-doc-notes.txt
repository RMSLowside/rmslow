If a user wants to retrieve a document that is currently only in physical form:

Scenario 1:
- User searches for document X by guide #
- The document has a piece of metadata that shows it is physical
- User clicks a button to request the document be digitized
- Request goes onto a queue; some sort of status is shown for what step of the digitization process the document is in
- SMART / Warehousing tool pulls request from queue, does black box magic to digitize document
- User is notified when this process is done
- User can then see the document digitally

Scenario 2:
- User searches for document X by guide #
- The document has a piece of metadata that shows it is physical
- User clicks a button to request a physical copy
- User fills out some sort of form for location / courier dropoff logistics
- Request goes onto a queue; an email confirmation / update should be provided on the status of the courier (perhaps this would be on the warehousing tool)
- SMART / warehousing tool pulls request from queue, makes a copy of the document
- SMART / warehousing tool arranges for the document copy transfer
- Physical exchange occurs


Scenario 1 is in the ideal world that every piece of data can and will be digitized; Scenario 2 is a way this might happen if either not every piece of data can be digitized
in some form, or there is a case where a physical version of the document is preferred for some reason. Either way, it seems like SMART / the warehousing tool has a spot
in the process; I'm not sure how to remove that dependency, if that's possible.
