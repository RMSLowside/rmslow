# S3

This application is to be used to wrap S3 in a familiar file explorer view. This application relies on the file-explorer lib for all of the visuals. It is currently a good example on how to structure smart vs dumb components as all of the business logic is handledwith the app component and all fo the view logic is held within the file-explorer library. THiss apllication uses NGXS to manage the state. 

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test s3` to execute the unit tests.
