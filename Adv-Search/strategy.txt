The basics of the syntax this search is designed to conform to is:

& = AND operator
| = OR operator
! = NOT operator
() = grouping mechanism
"" = required for strings with multiple words / spaces

Current structure for adv search requires the ::: prefix and every term must be quoted:

:::"test" | "something else"

Desired:

test | "something else"

Single words by themselves should be searchable without quotes (multi-word search terms should still be quoted)
Also of note, & / | / ! must also be searchable, don't want to lose that.

Current thought:
- Tracking term boundary by replacing quote with <term> </term>
- The only way to search for nested quotes is to escape them; that logic is also used elsewhere)

termOpen = false;
for (c in charArray){
    if(c == '"' and is not preceded by '\'){
        if(!termOpen){
            replace quote with <term>
            termOpen = true;
        }
        else {
            replace quote with </term>
            termOpen = false;
        }
    }
}
